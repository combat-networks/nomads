This static version of libssl and libcrypto have been built using the -fPIC flag.
In order to do that, I changed the Configure script of openssl before compiling.
I would like to keep this directory and the library separeted from the rest of repository.

Now It is possible to build the wrapper linking openssl. The openssl version on the repository was not compiled using the -fPIC flag and it was impossible to link.


Thanks
Filippo
